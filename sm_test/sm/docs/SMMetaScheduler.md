# SM Scheduler

## What is the SM Scheduler

The SM Scheduler assists in the deployment process of SM services and resources that follow the application format and
development pattern. The goal is to simplify the complexity of the Manifest file and create some standard deployment
processes.

## How to use it 

Schedulers are used by configuring settings within the Manifest.yaml file for an application. Each scheduler has its own
configuration options that are available to change behaviour, as well as common configs for all schedulers.

Details on the Manifest file configuration:

[Manifest Documentation](../../shared/packaging/manifest/README.md)

Details on the Service Scheduler specific configurations:
